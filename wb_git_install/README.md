# How to use this command

## Description

`wb_git_install` installs commands from the [World Bank GitHub Stata repository](https://github.com/worldbank/stata).

Begin by installing the adofile from this location into your /ado/personal folder. It will then be able to access any command in the [src](https://github.com/worldbank/stata/tree/master/src) directory.

Commands still in substantial development can be found in the [dev](https://github.com/worldbank/stata/tree/master/dev) directory and will be made visible to _wb_git_install_ and posted on the [landing page](http://worldbank.github.io/stata/) after review. Please feel free to contribute to development of all commands!
